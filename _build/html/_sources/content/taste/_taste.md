# 品味 Taste

Interviewer:

> And how do you know what's the right direction?

Steve Jobs:

> You know ultimately it comes down to taste, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done, and try to bring these things in to what you are doing. Picasso had a saying "good artists copy, great artists steal", we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

随着技术的革新与生产力的进步，人类社会的供给能力将会越来越高。但是观察“美”的供给比例占比依然是屈指可数，因为好的创意始终是有限的。LLM 技术的广泛普及会对普通供给的量带来巨大的提高，但是对质的提升依然有限。因此需要发现、关注、收藏、研究“美”，进而提升品位。
